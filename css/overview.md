Choosing a CSS Theme
====================

There are four CSS themes available in Pegasus.

There are two [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com/) themes, one based on Creative Tim's [Material Kit](https://www.creative-tim.com/product/material-kit)
and [Material Dashboard](https://www.creative-tim.com/product/material-dashboard) products,
and one that is "unthemed". Additionally, you can use [Bulma](https://bulma.io/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

The look and feel of the site is slightly different for each framework, but the overall layout is the same.
Below are screenshots of the app in each of the four themes:

If you're not sure which framework you want to use,
you can change the setting on your project and download multiple copies of the codebase to try out different ones.
