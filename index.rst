===================================

Here you'll find everything you need to know about setting up and configuring Pegasus for your project.

You'll need a Pegasus license to proceed.
If you don't have one, head on over to `saaspegasus.com`_ to get yours.

If you're just getting started, you'll want to start with the :doc:`getting-started` guide.

The source for this documentation can be `found on Github <https://github.com/czue/pegasus-docs/>`_ and
contributions are most welcome!
