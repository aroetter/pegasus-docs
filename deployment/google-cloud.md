## Google Cloud

Pegasus can be deployed to Google Cloud Run using containers.
*This feature is in beta and Celery is not yet supported.*

To build for Google Cloud, choose the "google_cloud" option when installing Pegasus.
Then follow the steps below to deploy your app.

### Prerequisites

Pegasus deployments on Google Cloud Run loosely follow the
[Django on Cloud Run](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/cloud-run-django) guide.
However, instaed of running it in the Google Cloud Shell, we'll use the `gcloud` CLI on our development machine.
This allows you to more easily work with your existing codebase.

#### 1. Set up the `gcloud` sdk.

Though much of the setup can be completed in the cloud shell, you will need to install and configure the `gcloud` sdk
on your development machine. Follow [the google installation guide](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install) for your OS.

After you install the `gcloud` SDK you will also need to authenticate your account [as described here](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/provide-credentials-adc).
In particular, you will need to run:

```
gcloud auth login
gcloud init
```

#### 2. Create and connect your project.

Follow the instructions [in Step 2 of the Google guide](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/cloud-run-django#1)
to create a new project for your app and enable billing.

Once you've created your project you should be able to run:

```
gcloud projects list
```

On your development machine and see it.

Next run:

```
gcloud config set project <project_id>
```

To set the project as the default for future commands.

#### 3. Enable the Cloud APIs

As per [step 3 of the Google guide](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/cloud-run-django#2), run the following command
to enable the services needed for your application.

```
gcloud services enable \
  run.googleapis.com \
  sql-component.googleapis.com \
  sqladmin.googleapis.com \
  compute.googleapis.com \
  cloudbuild.googleapis.com \
  secretmanager.googleapis.com \
  artifactregistry.googleapis.com
```

This command takes a while to finish, but should eventually output something like:

```
Operation "operations/acf.cc11852d-40af-47ad-9d59-477a12847c9e" finished successfully.
```

*We will skip step 4 of Google's guide, since we already have a project and move on to step 5.* 

#### 4. Create the backing services.

*This section follows [step 5 of Google's guide](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/cloud-run-django#4), with some minor changes.*

**First create a service account:**

```
gcloud iam service-accounts create cloudrun-serviceaccount
```

**Set up your environment variables:**

Everything you will need is defined in `/deploy/.env.google.example`.
It is recommended that you copy this file to `.env.google` and update the values in it as needed---including setting
any passwords and keys to random, autogenerated values.
Once you have made all the modifications to this file, load it into your environment by running:

```
source deploy/.env.google
```

After running the above command you should be able to run the remaining commands in the same shell and
the variables will be swapped in.

```
gcloud artifacts repositories create containers --repository-format docker --location $REGION
```

**Create and configure the database:**

Next, create the database instance.
Note that in our `.env.google` file we are changing the instance name from the guide's `mysinstance` to something unique to your project,
and storing that as an environment variable.

```
gcloud sql instances create $DATABASE_INSTANCE_NAME --project $PROJECT_ID --database-version POSTGRES_14 --tier db-f1-micro --region $REGION
```

This command takes a long time to run.
Once it completes, create a database in the instance, again using a unique name instead of the guide's `mydatabase`:

```
gcloud sql databases create $DATABASE_NAME --instance $DATABASE_INSTANCE_NAME
```

Next, create the database user. Make sure you have set/changed `DATABASE_PASSWORD` in your `deploy/.env.google` file,
then run:

```
gcloud sql users create ${DATABASE_USER} --instance ${DATABASE_INSTANCE_NAME} --password ${DATABASE_PASSWORD}
```

And finally, grant the service account permission to access the DB:

```
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding $PROJECT_ID --member serviceAccount:${SERVICE_ACCOUNT} --role roles/cloudsql.client
```

**Create and configure the storage bucket:**

```
gcloud storage buckets create gs://${GS_BUCKET_NAME} --location ${REGION}
```

**Store configuration as a secret.**

Once you have completed the above you should have everything you need in place to run your app.
The final step before deploying is to save your configuration as a secret.

Create a file with the secrets needed by your app:

```
echo DATABASE_URL=\"${DATABASE_URL}\" > .env.secrets
echo GS_BUCKET_NAME=\"${GS_BUCKET_NAME}\" >> .env.secrets
echo SECRET_KEY=\"${SECRET_KEY}\" >> .env.secrets
```
You can use your already-created `deploy/.env.google` file for this, instead of creating it as per the guide's instructions.

To do this, run:

```
gcloud secrets create application_settings --data-file .env.secrets
```

And allow the service account to access it:
```
gcloud secrets add-iam-policy-binding application_settings --member serviceAccount:${SERVICE_ACCOUNT} --role roles/secretmanager.secretAccessor
```

### Create and deploy your docker containers

From here on out we'll stop using the guide, since Pegasus should handle everything else for you out of the box.
Also, instead of using a `Procfile` we'll use our own Docker container.

First make sure you have loaded your environment:

```
set -o allexport && source deploy/.env.google && set +o allexport
```

Now you can build your container for Google Cloud by running the following command.

```
make gcp-build
```

This, and all other `make` commands are defined in the `Makefile` in your project. You can see what they are doing there.




Build docker file:

```
docker build -t gcr.io/$PROJECT_ID/<your_image_name> . -f Dockerfile.web
```

Push docker file:
```
docker push gcr.io/$PROJECT_ID/<your_image_name>h
```

Deploy docker file:
```
gcloud run deploy django-cloudrun \
  --region $REGION \
  --image gcr.io/${PROJECT_ID}/<app_id>-cloudrun
  --set-cloudsql-instances ${PROJECT_ID}:${REGION}:myinstance \
  --set-secrets APPLICATION_SETTINGS=application_settings:latest \
  --service-account $SERVICE_ACCOUNT \
  --allow-unauthenticated
```

You can run migrations like this.

First create the job:

```
gcloud run jobs create migrate \
  --region $REGION \
  --image gcr.io/${PROJECT_ID}/<app_id>-cloudrun \
  --set-cloudsql-instances ${PROJECT_ID}:${REGION}:myinstance \
  --set-secrets APPLICATION_SETTINGS=application_settings:latest \
  --service-account $SERVICE_ACCOUNT \
  --command migrate
```

Then set your default region:

```
gcloud config set run/region $REGION
```



gcloud builds submit --config cloudmigrate.yaml  --substitutions _REGION=$REGION
```

This will create your image, upload it to Google's container registry, run your database migrations,
and collect your static files.

You can then deploy it to Google Cloud Run by running the following command,
replacing the variables as needed:

```
gcloud run deploy my-project --platform managed --region $REGION --image gcr.io/$PROJECT_ID/{project_slug}-cloudrun --add-cloudsql-instances ${PROJECT_ID}:${REGION}:your_instance  --allow-unauthenticated --set-env-vars=DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE={project_slug}.settings_google
```

Pegasus will also generate this command for you as the last line of `./scripts/google/cloud_run.sh`.

### Settings and Secrets

To tell Google Cloud to use your production settings you will need to set the
`DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=[project_slug].settings_production`.
If you use Pegasus's `cloudmigrate.yaml` file this will be handled automatically for you.

You can use Google Secret Manager to add additional settings and secrets by adding them
to `.env.production` and uploading it to Secret Manager using:

```
gcloud secrets versions add {project_slug}_settings --data-file .env.production
``` 

See `settings_production.py` for examples of using these secrets in your settings file.
