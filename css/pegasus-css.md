# Pegasus CSS

In addition to the above structure, Pegasus also ships with its own set of CSS classes to provide compatibility
across frameworks. These are mainly used in the examples and in JavaScript files.

Pegasus CSS classes are defined in `pegasus/<framework>.sass`, and they all begin with `pg-`.
You are welcome to leave them in and use them throughout your project.

If you prefer, you can also replace them with the native framework classes (for example, replacing all instances
of `pg-column` with `column` on Bulma, or `col-md` on Bootstrap).
