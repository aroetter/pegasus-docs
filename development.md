# Development

This documentation is for development on pegasus itself.

## Front-end

Use `npm` as a package manager.

Basically followed instructions from the [bulma setup docs](https://bulma.io/documentation/customize/with-webpack/).

```bash
npm init
npm install bulma css-loader extract-text-webpack-plugin@next node-sass sass-loader style-loader webpack webpack-cli --save-dev
```
