APIs
====

Pegasus comes with a rich ecosystem of APIs that can used by your app's front end as well as exposed to third-party developers.

## APIs in Pegasus

APIs in Pegasus consist of three pieces:

1. **API endpoints**, created with [Django Rest Framework (DRF)](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/).
   These are the Django views that serve your APIs.
2. **API schemas**, created with [drf-spectacular](https://drf-spectacular.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
   These are automatically created by your APIs, and can be used for API documentation and client generation.
   They follow the [OpenAPI 3](https://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.1.0) specification.
3. **API clients**, created by [OpenAPI Generator](https://openapi-generator.tech/). These can be used by developers 
   to interact with your APIs. Pegasus ships with a TypeScript (JavaScript) client that is used in your app's front end
   by the parts of the app that interact with the backend APIs (e.g. JavaScript charts, and the React/Vue demos).
   
This might sound like a lot of moving pieces, but, critically, *all the logic lives in the API endpoints themselves*.
The schemas are auto-generated by the endpoints, and the clients are auto-generated by the schemas.
So you only have to maintain your APIs in a single place, and everything else is kept in sync with tooling.

Using the schemas and clients is optional. You can always interact with a Pegasus API by making the appropriate
HTTP requests directly. However, using a client can greatly simplify the code you write and improve the development experience.

Additionally, getting API docs "for free" from the schemas can be a big win if you plan to make your project's 
API third-party-developer-facing.

## API Documentation

By default, your Pegasus app ships with two built-in sets of API documentation available at the `/api/schema/swagger-ui/` endpoint
([http://localhost:8000/api/schema/swagger-ui](http://localhost:8000/api/schema/swagger-ui) in development) and `/api/schema/redoc/` endpoint
([http://localhost:8000/api/schema/redoc/](http://localhost:8000/api/schema/redoc/) in development).

The API docs will look something like this:

**Swagger API docs:**

## API Keys

Pegasus supports the use of API Keys to access APIs, built on top of the 
[Django REST Framework API Key](https://florimondmanca.github.io/djangorestframework-api-key/) project.

Pegasus includes the ability to create API keys, associate them with your User objects, and access APIs using the key.

### Creating and managing API keys

A simple UI for creating, viewing, and revoking API keys is available to end users from the Profile page.

More advanced/customized management of API keys---including the ability to associate names and expiry dates with keys---is
available through the Django admin interface.

Note that when an API key is created it will be displayed *once* and will not be available after that.

For more details on working with API keys see [the library documentation](https://florimondmanca.github.io/djangorestframework-api-key/guide/#creating-and-managing-api-keys).

### API keys and Users

Pegasus associates API keys with your Django `User` objects.
This is a good, practical way to get started with API key scoping.
All access granted by the key will the same as the associated `CustomUser` object, which allow you to easily
create APIs that work with logged-in users *or* API keys.

The `apps.api.models.UserAPIKey` class is used to associate an API key with a `CustomUser`.
You can then enable API keys for any user-specific views, by following the instructions for `APIView`s and `ViewSet`s below.

More complex API key permissions---for example, associating a key with a single API or a single team---can
be created by following [these instructions](https://florimondmanca.github.io/djangorestframework-api-key/guide/#api-key-models).

To enable API-key support for an `APIView`, or `ViewSet`, use the `IsAuthenticatedOrHasUserAPIKey` permission class 
in place of `IsAuthenticated`. This will allow either authenticated users or UserAPIKey users to access the APIs.
In either case, the associated user object will be available as `request.user`.

You can see an example `APIView` in the `EmployeeDataAPIView` class that ships with the Pegasus examples,
and an example `ViewSet` in the `EmployeeViewSet` code.

### Testing API keys

The easiest way to test API key functionality is to use a tool like [curl](https://curl.se/).

The following command can be used to test a user-based API key with a default Pegasus installation:

```
curl http://localhost:8000/pegasus/employees/api/employees/ -H "Authorization: Api-Key <your-api-key>"
```

You should replace `<your-api-key>` with the API key displayed when it is created.
