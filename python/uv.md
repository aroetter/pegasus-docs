Working with Python Packages (uv)
=================================

Recent versions of Pegasus use [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) to manage Python packages.
It provides all the functionality of pip-tools while being much faster and offering more flexibility
and features.

### Requirements Files

`uv` uses two files to manage requirements. The first is a `pyproject.toml` file, which contains the
base list of packages. The `pyproject.toml` file also supports dependency groups, which are used
for development and production requirements.
`pyproject.toml` replaces the previous `requirements.in`, `dev-requirements.in`, and `prod-requirements.in` files.

The second file is the `uv.lock` file. This file contains the pinned versions of dependencies
that are used by the project's environment.
This file is automatically generated from the `pyproject.toml` file and *should not be edited by hand*.
`uv.lock` replaces the previous `requirements.txt`, `dev-requirements.txt`, and `prod-requirements.txt` files.
